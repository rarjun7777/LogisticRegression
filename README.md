-> We predicted whether a person can buy a new car released in the market based on their age and estimated salary . 

Dataset : Social_Network_Ads

# STEPS IN LOGISTIC REGRESSION 

-> Importing the libraries

-> Importing the dataset

-> Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set

-> Feature Scaling

-> Training the Logistic Regression model on the Training set

-> Predicting a new result

-> Predicting the Test set results
